**<h2>Movie Trailer WebSite</h2>**

<h4> Project Details </h4>
Created a data structure (Python class - Movie) to store the list of favorite movies with a title, URL, Youtube link to movie trailer
Instances for this class are created with the details as needed in a file named ‘moviedata.py’. These instances are stored in an array named ‘movies’.


<h4> Steps to Run </h4>
Navigate to the folder containing all the files in the terminal(cd to the directory) and run the following command :
```
 python moviedata.py
```

This calls the ```open_movies_page``` method in the fresh_tomatoes.py file with ```movies``` as argument and creates an output file named ```fresh_tomatoes.html``` and opens it in browser.
